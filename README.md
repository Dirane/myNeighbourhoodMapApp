# Project 4: Build a Neighbourhood Map

## Introduction
This application shows the locations I am interested in marked down on the map in Buea.
When one of the location is clicked, a popup window shows additional info about the location from foursquare.

## How to run this program
First you need to have internet connection
Download the project files and open the file 'myNeighbourhoodMap.html' with your suitable browser.

### Project comments and Credits
On my side this was a very challenging project for me
[Udacity neighbourhood map review on github]("https://github.com/udacity/fend-office-hours/tree/master/Javascript%20Design%20Patterns/P5%20Project%20Overview")
I had a look and got inspiration from [this]("http://jshanks24.github.io/Udacity-Neighborhood-Map")
